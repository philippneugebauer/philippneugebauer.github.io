I'm a master's student in Information Systems at Otto-Friedrich-University of Bamberg.
I already received my bachelor's degree from there and went abroad for one year to Free University of Bozen-Bolzano.

I'm mostly interested in software development, especially Ruby on Rails, Java and database improvements.
All of my projects are developed with Git which is just a great version control system.
Actually, I'm going to write my master's thesis about Cloud databases.
