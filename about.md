|I graduated from Otto-Friedrich-University of Bamberg with a master's and bachelor's degree in information systems, whereby my master's thesis covered cloud databases. In doing so, I went abroad to Free University of Bozen-Bolzano for one year.||
|I'm mostly interested in software development, especially Ruby on Rails, Java and database optimizations. All of my projects are developed with Git, a great version control system.||
