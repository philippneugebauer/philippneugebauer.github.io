|I graduated from Otto-Friedrich-University of Bamberg with a master's and bachelor's degree in information systems, whereby my master's thesis covered cloud databases. In doing so, I went abroad to Free University of Bozen-Bolzano for one year.||
|After finishing my studies in 2015, I travelled the world for a year and work now for [innoQ Deutschland GmbH](www.innoq.com)||
|I'm mostly interested in software development, especially Ruby on Rails, multi-tenancy and database optimizations. All of my projects are developed with Git, a great version control system.||
