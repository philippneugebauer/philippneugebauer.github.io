|I'm a master's student in information systems at Otto-Friedrich-University of Bamberg. I already graduated there with a bachelor's degree and went abroad to Free University of Bozen-Bolzano for one year.||
|I'm mostly interested in software development, especially Ruby on Rails, Java and database improvements. All of my projects are developed with Git, a great version control system. Recently, I finished my master's thesis about cloud databases.||
