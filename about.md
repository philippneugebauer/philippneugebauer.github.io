|I'm a master's student in Information Systems at Otto-Friedrich-University of Bamberg. I already received my bachelor's degree from there and went abroad for one year to Free University of Bozen-Bolzano.||
|I'm mostly interested in software development, especially Ruby on Rails, Java and database improvements. All of my projects are developed with Git which is just a great version control system. Actually, I'm going to write my master's thesis about Cloud databases.||
