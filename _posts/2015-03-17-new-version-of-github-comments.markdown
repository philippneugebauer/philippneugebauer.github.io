The author of the [extension](https://github.com/wireddown/ghpages-ghcomments) I use for this blog to enable commenting has released due to our feedback a new version.

I will update to this version in the next days because it allows a much smoother commenting
e.g. through the not anymore required leaving of the blog page.
