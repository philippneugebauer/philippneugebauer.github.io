Today, I was able to publish version `0.1.0` of my `simple_controller` gem.
It supports now module names in the controllers and includes fixes for the path redirecting problem.
Additionally, I resolved the problem with the code coverage and therefore Code Climate confirms now a great coverage of 96%.

Have a look at [it](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/SimpleController).
