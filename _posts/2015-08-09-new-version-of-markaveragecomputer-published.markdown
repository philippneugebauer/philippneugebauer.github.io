In addition to the development on the `simple_controller` gem, I published version v2.2 of my mark average computer.
It supports now the `CTRL+S` shortcut for saving and visualizes the mark average development during your studies.
Further, I simplified and improved the code to allow an easier maintaining.

Finally, I plan to publish the code as open source when the code refactoring is completed.
The `jar` can be found [here](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/Mark-Average-Computer-Wiki) and further instructions and details are available [here](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/Mark-Average-Computer-Wiki/wiki).
