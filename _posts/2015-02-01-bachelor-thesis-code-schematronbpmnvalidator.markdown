I released today the code of my bachelor thesis under LGPLv3. It checks constraints not covered by the standard OMG XSD files. The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/SchematronBPMNValidator), together with an extensive description of the tool. 
Findbugs and PMD in combination with Gradle were used to improve the code quality and to fix bugs. Furthermore, Travis CI is used for continous integration.
