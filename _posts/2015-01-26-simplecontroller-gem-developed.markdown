I was always reasoning how I could resolve all the [CodeClimate]{www.codeclimate.com} duplication messages for my controllers.

I thought about a generic controller to resolve the issue, but I was always concerning about the best implementation.
Two weeks ago I was again overthinking a good solution and I just came up with the implementation
published at [SimpleController](www.github.com/philippneugebauer/SimpleController) GitHub Repo.

Although there are up to now just very simple controller methods supported,
I could improve the CodeClimate rating of three controllers from C to A.

I appreciate any kind of feedback, either via mail or on [Github](www.github.com/philippneugebauer/SimpleController/issues)
