I was always reasoning how I could resolve all the [CodeClimate](https://www.codeclimate.com) duplication messages for my controllers. I thought about a generic controller to resolve the issue, but I was always concerning about the best implementation.

Two weeks ago I was again overthinking a good solution and I just came up with the implementation
published at [SimpleController GitHub Repo](https://www.github.com/philippneugebauer/SimpleController).

Although there are up to now just very simple controller methods supported,
I already could improve the CodeClimate rating of three controllers from C to A.

I appreciate any kind of feedback, either via mail or on [Github](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/SimpleController/issues).
